# notionNextSite

This is an example of creating a site using notion as a CMS.

## Getting Started

1. make a .env file from .env.example with your credentials:
```
NOTION TOKEN="NOTION INTEGRATION TOKEN"
NOTION_DATABASE_ID="YOUR NOTION DATABASE ID"
```

2. run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
